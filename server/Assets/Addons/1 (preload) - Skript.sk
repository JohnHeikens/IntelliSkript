#Block Data
#Block data is the detailed information about a block, referred to in Minecraft as BlockStates, allowing for the manipulation of different aspects of the block, including shape, waterlogging, direction the block is facing, and so much more. Information regarding each block's optional data can be found on Minecraft's Wiki. Find the block you're looking for and scroll down to 'Block States'. Different states must be separated by a semicolon (see examples). The 'minecraft:' namespace is optional, as well as are underscores.

#set block at player to campfire[lit=false]

#Inventory Slot
#Represents a single slot of an inventory. Notable slots are the armour slots and furnace slots. 
#The most important property that distinguishes a slot from an item is its ability to be changed, e.g. it can be set, deleted, enchanted, etc. (Some item expressions can be changed as well, e.g. items stored in variables. For that matter: slots are never saved to variables, only the items they represent at the time when the variable is set).
#Please note that tool can be regarded a slot, but it can actually change it's position, i.e. doesn't represent always the same slot.
#since 
#Examples:
#set tool of player to dirt
#delete helmet of the victim
#set the colour of the player's tool to green
#enchant the player's chestplate with projectile protection 5

#Item / Material
#An item, e.g. a stack of torches, a furnace, or a wooden sword of sharpness 2. Unlike item type an item can only represent exactly one item (e.g. an upside-down cobblestone stair facing west), while an item type can represent a whole range of items (e.g. any cobble stone stairs regardless of direction).
#You don't usually need this type except when you want to make a command that only accepts an exact item.
#Please note that currently 'material' is exactly the same as 'item', i.e. can have an amount & enchantments.
#since 1.0
#Examples:
#set {_item} to type of the targeted block
#{_item} is a torch
type:
	patterns:
		item
		material

#Item Type
#An item type is an alias, e.g. 'a pickaxe', 'all plants', etc., and can result in different items when added to an inventory, and unlike items they are well suited for checking whether an inventory contains a certain item or whether a certain item is of a certain type.
#An item type can also have one or more enchantments with or without a specific level defined, and can optionally start with 'all' or 'every' to make this item type represent all types that the alias represents, including data ranges.
#since 1.0
#Examples:
#give 4 torches to the player
#add all slabs to the inventory of the block
#player's tool is a diamond sword of sharpness
#remove a pickaxes of fortune 4 from {stored items::*}

#Examples:
#add 10£ to the player's account

#Text
#Text is simply text, i.e. a sequence of characters, which can optionally contain expressions which will be replaced with a meaningful representation (e.g. %player% will be replaced with the player's name).

#Parses text as a given type, or as a given pattern.

#If the given text could not be parsed, this expression will return nothing and the parse error will be set if some information is available.
#Some notes about parsing with a pattern:
#- The pattern must be a Skript pattern, e.g. percent signs are used to define where to parse which types, e.g. put a %number% or %items% in the pattern if you expect a number or some items there.
#- You have to save the expression's value in a list variable, e.g. set {parsed::*} to message parsed as "...".
#- The list variable will contain the parsed values from all %types% in the pattern in order. If a type was plural, e.g. %items%, the variable's value at the respective index will be a list variable, e.g. the values will be stored in {parsed::1::*}, not {parsed::1}.

#Examples:
#set {var} to line 1 parsed as number
