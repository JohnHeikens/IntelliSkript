#Item Type
#An item type is an alias, e.g. 'a pickaxe', 'all plants', etc., and can result in different items when added to an inventory, and unlike items they are well suited for checking whether an inventory contains a certain item or whether a certain item is of a certain type.
#An item type can also have one or more enchantments with or without a specific level defined, and can optionally start with 'all' or 'every' to make this item type represent all types that the alias represents, including data ranges.
#since 1.0
#Examples:
#give 4 torches to the player
#add all slabs to the inventory of the block
#player's tool is a diamond sword of sharpness
#remove a pickaxes of fortune 4 from {stored items::*}
#set {_item} to 10 of every upside-down stair
#block is dirt or farmland

#set {_p} to "Notch" parsed as a player  returns <none> unless Notch is actually online or starts with Notch like Notchan
#set {_p} to "N" parsed as a player  returns Notch if Notch is online because their name starts with 'N' (case insensitive) however, it would return nothing if no player whose name starts with 'N' is online.

#Loop
#Loop sections repeat their code with multiple values.
#A loop will loop through all elements of the given expression, e.g. all players, worlds, items, etc. The conditions & effects inside the loop will be executed for every of those elements, which can be accessed with ‘loop-’, e.g. <code>send "hello" to loop-player. When a condition inside a loop is not fulfilled the loop will start over with the next element of the loop. You can however use stop loop to exit the loop completely and resume code execution after the end of the loop.
#Loopable Values
#All expressions that represent more than one value, e.g. ‘all players’, ‘worlds’, etc., as well as list variables, can be looped. You can also use a list of expressions, e.g. loop the victim and the attacker, to execute the same code for only a few values.
#List Variables
#When looping list variables, you can also use loop-index in addition to loop-value inside the loop. loop-value is the value of the currently looped variable, and loop-index is the last part of the variable's name (the part where the list variable has its asterisk *).
#since 1.0
#Examples:
#loop all players:
#	send "Hello %loop-player%!" to loop-player
#loop items in player's inventory:
#	if loop-item is dirt:
#		set loop-item to air
#loop 10 times:
#	send title "%11 - loop-value%" and subtitle "seconds left until the game begins" to player for 1 second  10, 9, 8 etc.
#	wait 1 second
#loop {Coins::*}:
#	set {Coins::%loop-index%} to loop-value + 5  Same as "add 5 to {Coins::%loop-index%}" where loop-index is the uuid of the player and loop-value is the number of coins for the player
#loop shuffled (integers between 0 and 8):
#	if all:

#Spawn
#Spawns entities. This can be used as an effect and as a section.
#If it is used as a section, the section is run before the entity is added to the world.
#You can modify the entity in this section, using for example 'event-entity' or 'cow'. 
#Do note that other event values, such as 'player', won't work in this section.
#If you're spawning a display and want it to be empty on initialization, like not having a block display be stone, set hidden config node 'spawn empty displays' to true.
#Note that when spawning an entity via entity snapshots, the code within the section will not run instantaneously as compared to spawning normally (via 'a zombie').

#Register Tag
#Registers a new tag containing either items or entity datas. Note that items will NOT keep any information other than their type, so adding `diamond sword named "test"` to a tag is the same as adding `diamond sword`
#Item tags should be used for contexts where the item is not placed down, while block tags should be used for contexts where the item is placed. For example, and item tag could be "skript:edible", while a block tag would be "skript:needs_water_above".
#All custom tags will be given the namespace "skript", followed by the name you give it. The name must only include the characters A to Z, 0 to 9, and '/', '.', '_', and '-'. Otherwise, the tag will not register.
#Please note that two tags can share a name if they are of different types. Registering a new tag of the same name and type will overwrite the existing tag. Tags will reset on server shutdown.
#since 2.10
#Examples:
#register a new custom entity tag named "fish" using cod, salmon, tropical fish, and pufferfish
#register an item tag named "skript:wasp_weapons/swords" containing diamond sword and netherite sword
#register block tag named "pokey" containing sweet berry bush and bamboo sapling

#Rotate
#Rotates displays, quaternions, or vectors around an axis a set amount of degrees, or around all 3 axes at once.
#Vectors can only be rotated around the global X/Y/Z axes, or an arbitrary vector axis.
#Quaternions are more flexible, allowing rotation around the global or local X/Y/Z axes, arbitrary vectors, or all 3 local axes at once.
#Global axes are the ones in the Minecraft world. Local axes are relative to how the quaternion is already oriented.
#Rotating a display is a shortcut for rotating its left rotation. If the right rotation needs to be modified, it should be acquired, rotated, and re-set.
#Note that rotating a quaternion/display around a vector results in a rotation around the local vector, so results may not be what you expect. For example, rotating quaternions/displays around vector(1, 0, 0) is the same as rotating around the local X axis.
#The same applies to rotations by all three axes at once. In addition, rotating around all three axes of a quaternion/display at once will rotate in ZYX order, meaning the Z rotation will be applied first and the X rotation last.
#since 2.2-dev28, 2.10 (quaternions, displays)
#Examples:
#rotate {_quaternion} around x axis by 10 degrees
#rotate last spawned block display around y axis by 10 degrees
#rotate {_vector} around vector(1, 1, 1) by 45
#rotate {_quaternion} by x 45, y 90, z 135

#Sprinting
#Make a player start or stop sprinting.
#If the player is not moving when this effect is used, they will be put in sprint mode for a tick and then stopped (this causes the FOV to change). Using it a second time, without the player manually sprinting in between, causes the player to stay in sprint mode, with some quirks.
# - Particles may not be produced under the player's feet.
# - The player will not exit the sprinting state if they stop moving.
# - Restrictions like low hunger will not prevent the player from sprinting
# - The player pressing shift will stop them sprinting, and pressing sprint will re-assert normal sprinting behavior
#Using this effect two or more consecutive times on a stationary player produces undefined behavior and should not be relied on.

#- The pattern must be a Skript pattern, e.g. percent signs are used to define where to parse which types, e.g. put a %number% or %items% in the pattern if you expect a number or some items there.
#- You have to save the expression's value in a list variable, e.g. set {parsed::*} to message parsed as "...".
#- The list variable will contain the parsed values from all %types% in the pattern in order. If a type was plural, e.g. %items%, the variable's value at the respective index will be a list variable, e.g. the values will be stored in {parsed::1::*}, not {parsed::1}.
