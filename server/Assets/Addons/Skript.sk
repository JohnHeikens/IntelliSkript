#Parses text as a given type, or as a given pattern.

#If the given text could not be parsed, this expression will return nothing and the parse error will be set if some information is available.
#Some notes about parsing with a pattern:
#- The pattern must be a Skript pattern, e.g. percent signs are used to define where to parse which types, e.g. put a %number% or %items% in the pattern if you expect a number or some items there.
#- You have to save the expression's value in a list variable, e.g. set {parsed::*} to message parsed as "...".
#- The list variable will contain the parsed values from all %types% in the pattern in order. If a type was plural, e.g. %items%, the variable's value at the respective index will be a list variable, e.g. the values will be stored in {parsed::1::*}, not {parsed::1}.
